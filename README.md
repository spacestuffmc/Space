# CrystalSpace [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace)

### Unofficial effort to revive the functionality of a powerful plugin


## What

**CrystalSpace** is the [CrystalCraftMC](http://crystalcraftmc.com) fork of bSpace. CrystalSpace is a [Bukkit/Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin that is a terrain engine for Minecraft. With CrystalSpace, you will have a void world created and populated with planetoid objects, such as small planets, stars, satellites, and more. This plugin provides the barebones you need for your very own space-themed server.

I decided to make this a long-term project for my own server to not only use on my own server, but to recreate one of the most amazing gametypes known in world of non-modded Minecraft servers.


## Where

[jflory7](https://github.com/jflory7) is responsible for the fork of this project. [iffa](https://github.com/iffa), an original developer, also occasionally contributes. Between the many hats I wear, progress on this plugin is slow, but help is always welcome and appreciated in the form of [bug reports](https://github.com/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace/pulls).

You can find the original bSpace plugin on [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/bananaspace/), but note that we are not associated with that project page.

### CI Server

This project had a [continuous-integration build server](http://ci.crystalcraftmc.com/), but due to financial issues, the CI server is no longer available. We hope to be able to offer this again someday in the future. (Someone willing to host one for this would be awesome!!)


## Building

This project can be compiled and built with Maven. To build the project, open a terminal, enter the directory of this repository, and run the following command.

`mvn clean package`

This will generate the latest version of the plugin locally for you.


## Licensing

This project is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/).

Forking and modifying the plugin is permitted, but if you're going to work on this project, it would be greatly appreciated to return your work upstream.
