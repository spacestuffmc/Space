#Space [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace)

### Unofficial effort to revive the functionality of a powerful plugin


## What

**Space** is the fork of bSpace. CrystalSpace is a [Bukkit/Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin that is a terrain engine for Minecraft. With CrystalSpace, you will have a void world created and populated with planetoid objects, such as small planets, stars, satellites, and more. This plugin provides the barebones you need for your very own space-themed server.

I decided to make this a long-term project for my own server to not only use on my own server, but to recreate one of the most amazing gametypes known in world of non-modded Minecraft servers.


## Building

This project can be compiled and built with Maven. To build the project, open a terminal, enter the directory of this repository, and run the following command.

`mvn clean package`

This will generate the latest version of the plugin locally for you.


## Licensing

This project is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/).

Forking and modifying the plugin is permitted, but if you're going to work on this project, it would be greatly appreciated to return your work upstream.
